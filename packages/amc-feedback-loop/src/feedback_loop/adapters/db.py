Database adapter -- abstract contract + in-memory stub.

AbstractDatabaseAdapter defines the exact persistence surface the pipeline

adapter, etc.) inherit from it and supply real DB operations.

InMemoryDatabaseAdapter is a thread-safe dict-backed stub for tests and
local development -- it has no external dependencies.
